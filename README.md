# 2DGameEngine

Its finished other than a final project which is a map editor.

It uses SDL2 for access to graphics, images, fonts and dear imgui rendering. \
It uses C++ for the engine and Lua for scripting.

I learned about :
- C++ : About everything that i didn't get it when i was coding in unreal. Smart pointers, maps, vectors, being more data oriented.
- Game scripting with Lua binded with Sol library
- SDL2
- Dear ImGui
- Data oriented design and why its better
- ECS design for game engines and why they are used

Engine uses ECS for its design and a little bit of data oriented design.

Im aware that :
- some functions like Registry.HasTag lack validation
- projectile class is hardcoded for bullets
- there is very little error logging
- and some more.

I don't plan to fix these things because i don't plan to use this engine. while taking a course is draining and time consuming,\
i don't want to put more time into making things validated and dynamic.

I still tried to make things validated and dynamic other than things that don't teach me anything.

Footage for a very simple demo built-in to the engine.
