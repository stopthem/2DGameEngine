# 2DGameEngine

Currently under development.

Custom 2D Game engine with the help of www.pikuma.com/courses/cpp-2d-game-engine-development .

It uses SDL2 for access to graphics, images, fonts and sounds. \
It uses c++ for the engine and lua for scripting.

Engine uses ECS for its design.
<br>
Im aware that some functions like Registry.HasTag lack validation,\
im aware that projectile class is hardcoded for bullets,\
and much more.

I don't plan to fix these things because i don't plan to use this engine. while taking a course is draining and time consuming,\
i don't want to put more time into making things validated and dynamic.

I still try to make somethings validated and dynamic other than things that don't teach me anything like Registry.HasTag, i just implement the way course did.
